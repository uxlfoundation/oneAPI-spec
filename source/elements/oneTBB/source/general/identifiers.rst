Identifiers
===========

This section describes the identifier conventions used by oneAPI Threading Building Blocks.

Case
----

The identifier convention in the library follows the style in the ISO C++ standard library. Identifiers are written in underscore_style, and concepts in PascalCase.

Reserved Identifier Prefixes
----------------------------

The library reserves the prefix ``__TBB`` for internal identifiers and macros that should never be directly referenced by your code.
