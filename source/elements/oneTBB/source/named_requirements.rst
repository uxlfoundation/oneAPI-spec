Named Requirements
==================
**[named_requirements]**

This section describes named requirements used in the oneTBB Specification.

A *named requirement* is a set of requirements on a type. The requirements may be syntactic or semantic.
The *named requirement* term is similar to “Requirements on types and expressions” term which is defined
by the ISO C++ Standard (chapter “Library Introduction”) or
`“Named Requirements” section <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req>`_ on the cppreference.com site.

For example, the named requirement of *sortable* could be defined as a set of requirements that enable
an array to be sorted. A type ``T`` would be *sortable* if:

* ``x < y`` returns a boolean value, and represents a total order on items of type ``T``.
* ``swap(x,y)`` swaps items ``x`` and ``y``

You can write a sorting template function in C++ that sorts an array of any type that is *sortable*.

.. _pseudo_signatures:

Pseudo-Signatures
-----------------

Two approaches for defining named requirements are *valid expressions* and *pseudo-signatures*.
The ISO C++ standard follows the valid *expressions* approach, which shows what the usage pattern looks like for a requirement.
It has the drawback of relegating important details to notational conventions. This document mostly uses
pseudo-signatures because they are concise and can be cut-and-pasted for an initial implementation.

A pseudo-signature describes how an implementation interacts with a type or a function.
A real function signature (after template instantiation, if applicable) may differ from the pseudo-signature
that it implements in ways where implicit conversions would deal with the difference,
transforming function parameter types from the ones in the pseudo-signature to the real signature,
and transforming the actual return value type to the one in the pseudo-signature.

For example, the table below shows pseudo-signatures for a *sortable* type ``T``:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Sortable Requirements : Pseudo-Signature, Semantics**

.. cpp:function:: bool operator<(const T& x, const T& y)

  Compare ``x`` and ``y``.

.. cpp:function:: void swap(T& x, T& y)

  Swap ``x`` and ``y``.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a given type ``U``, the real signature that implements ``operator<`` in the table above 
can be expressed as ``int operator<( U x, U y )``, because C++ permits implicit conversion from
``int`` to ``bool``, and implicit conversion from ``const U&`` to ``U`` if the type is copy-constructible.
As a counter-example, the real signature ``bool operator<( U& x, U& y )`` is not acceptable
because C++ does not permit implicit removal of the ``const`` qualifier from a type, and so the code
would not compile if the implementation attempts to pass a constant object to the function.

Besides pseudo-signatures, semantic requirements also need to be met by real types and functions.
For example, while ``std::pair<U, U> swap(U x, U y)`` fits the pseudo-signature for *Sortable*
via implicit conversion of references to values and implicit drop of the returned value
(ignored by a library implementation), it is unable to swap the actual variables passed to the function
and therefore does not meet the semantic requirements of *Sortable*.

The following table provides guidance for the types of parameters used in pseudo-signatures.

==========================  ================================  =============================
Pseudo-signature parameter  General semantics                 Alternative real parameters
==========================  ================================  =============================
``const T& x``              The function is not supposed      - ``T x``
                            to modify the argument.           - ``U& x``
                                                              - ``U&& x``
                                                              
                                                              where ``U`` is a template type parameter or ``auto``

``T& x``                    The argument is a lvalue.         - ``const T& x``
                            The function can or is            - ``T x``
                            supposed to modify the argument.  - ``U& x``
                                                              - ``U&& x``

``T&& x``                   The argument is a rvalue. The     - ``const T& x``
                            function can use the argument     - ``T x``
                            as a source in move operations.   - ``U&& x``
==========================  ================================  =============================

In practice, alternatives might depend on the semantic requirements as well as type properties,
such as availability of copy- or move-constructors.
