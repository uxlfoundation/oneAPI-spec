Parallel API
------------

oneDPL provides the set of parallel algorithms as defined by the `C++ Standard`_,
including parallel algorithms added in the 6th edition known as C++20.
All those algorithms work with *C++ Standard aligned execution policies* and with
*device execution policies*.

oneDPL also provides *parallel range algorithms*: variations of C++20 range-based algorithms
that take a oneDPL execution policy.

Additionally, oneDPL provides wrapper functions for `SYCL`_ buffers, special iterators, and
a set of non-standard parallel algorithms.
