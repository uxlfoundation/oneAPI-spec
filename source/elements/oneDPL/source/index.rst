The |dpl_full_name| (oneDPL) provides the functionality
specified in the `C++ standard`_, with extensions to support data parallelism
and offloading to devices, and with extensions to simplify its usage for 
implementing data parallel algorithms.

.. note::
    Unless specified otherwise, in this document the `C++ standard`_ refers to
    ISO/IEC 14882:2017 Programming languages - C++, commonly known as C++17. 

The library is comprised of the following components:

- :doc:`Parallel API <parallel_api>`:

  * Parallel algorithms, complemented with execution
    policies and companion APIs for running on oneAPI devices.

  * An additional set of library classes and functions that
    are known to be useful in practice but are not yet included into
    C++ or SYCL specifications. 

- :doc:`SYCL Kernels API <sycl_kernels_api>`:

  * A subset of the C++ standard library which can be used with
    buffers and data parallel kernels.

  * Support of random number generation including engines and distributions.

  * Various utilities in addition to the C++ standard functionality.
