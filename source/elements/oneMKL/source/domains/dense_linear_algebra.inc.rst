Dense Linear Algebra
---------------------

This section contains information about dense linear algebra routines:

:ref:`matrix-storage` provides information about dense matrix and vector storage formats that are used by oneMKL :ref:`onemkl_blas` and :ref:`onemkl_lapack`.

:ref:`onemkl_blas` provides vector, matrix-vector, and matrix-matrix routines for dense matrices and vector operations.

:ref:`onemkl_lapack` provides more complex dense linear algbra routines, e.g., solving dense systems of linear equations, least square problems, eigenvalue, singular value problems, and Sylvester's equations.
