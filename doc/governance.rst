 Governance

Roles
=====

Each oneAPI element has a **core team** and **lead** who are the
primary authors for the specification. The community is invited to
make feature requests or proposals, which are reviewed by the core
team.

The overall specification also has a core team and lead. The **oneAPI
core team** is responsible for issues that involve multiple oneAPI
elements and provides general oversight.



Decision Making
===============

Specification changes and other decisions are by `consensus
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_is_consensus>`__ of the
appropriate core team. The lead determines if consensus has been
reached and what action to take when there is disagreement. Decision
making balances the needs of the community, including: technical
advisory boards, implementations, and users. Decision making is
transparent, with clear explanations and constructive feedback for
rejected proposals.


Membership
==========

A core team may decide to add new members or designate a new
lead. Members will typically have a history of contribution to the
specification, contribution to an implementation, or as an end-user of
an implementation. Membership is open to all companies, institutions,
and implementations.


Commit Rights
=============

Committers follow the direction of the core team. Core teams decide
who has commit rights to the repository.


Governance Changes
==================

Governance is intended to be informal and low overhead while
encouraging broad participation from the community. oneAPI core team
may change governance as the community evolves.
