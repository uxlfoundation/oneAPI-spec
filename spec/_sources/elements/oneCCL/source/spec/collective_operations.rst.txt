Collective Operations
=====================

oneCCL specification defines the following collective communication operations:

- `Allgatherv`_
- `Allreduce`_
- `Alltoallv`_
- `Barrier`_
- `Broadcast`_
- `Reduce`_
- `ReduceScatter`_

These operations are collective, meaning that all participants (ranks) of oneCCL communicator should make a call.
The order of collective operation calls should be the same across all ranks.

``communicator`` shall provide the ability to perform communication operations either on host or device memory buffers depending on the ``device`` used to create the communicator. Additionally, communication operations shall accept an execution context (stream) and may accept a vector of events that the communication operation should depend on, that is, input dependencies. The output ``event`` object shall provide the ability to track the progress of the operation.

.. note::
    Support for handling of input events is optional

``BufferType`` is used below to define the C++ type of elements in data buffers (``buf``, ``send_buf`` and  ``recv_buf``) of communication operations. At least the following types shall be supported: ``[u]int{8/16/32/64}_t``, ``float``, ``double``. The explicit ``datatype`` parameter shall be used to enable data types which cannot be inferred from the function arguments.

.. note::
    See also: :ref:`Custom Datatypes`

The communication operation accepts a ``stream`` object. If a communicator is created from ``native_device_type``, then the stream shall translate to ``native_stream_type`` created from the corresponding device.

The communication operation may accept attribute object. If that parameter is missed, then the default attribute object is used (default_<operation_name>_attr). The default attribute object shall be provided by the library.

.. note::
    See also: :doc:`operation_attributes`

If the arguments provided to a communication operation call do not comply to the requirements of the operation, the behavior is undefined unless it is specified otherwise.

.. _Allgatherv:

Allgatherv
**********

Allgatherv is a collective communication operation that collects data from all the ranks within a communicator into a single buffer. Different ranks may contribute segments of different sizes. The resulting data in the output buffer must be the same for each rank.
