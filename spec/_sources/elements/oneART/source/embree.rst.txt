Embree

Embree is a collection of high-performance ray tracing kernels. The
Embree target users are graphics application engineers who want to
improve the performance of their photo-realistic rendering application
by leveraging Embree’s performance-optimized ray tracing
kernels. Embree supports runtime code selection to choose the
traversal and build algorithms that best matches the instruction set
of your CPU.

Embree supports applications written with the Intel® SPMD Program
Compiler (ISPC, https://ispc.github.io/) by also providing an ISPC
interface to the core ray tracing algorithms. This makes it possible
to write a renderer in ISPC that automatically vectorizes and
leverages SSE, AVX, AVX2, and AVX-512 instructions. ISPC also supports
runtime code selection, thus ISPC will select the best code path for
your application.

Embree contains algorithms optimized for incoherent workloads
(e.g. Monte Carlo ray tracing algorithms) and coherent workloads
(e.g. primary visibility and hard shadow rays).

The single-ray traversal kernels of Embree provide high performance
for incoherent workloads and are very easy to integrate into existing
rendering applications. Using the stream kernels, even higher
performance for incoherent rays is possible, but integration might
require significant code changes to the application to use the stream
paradigm. In general for coherent workloads, the stream mode with
coherent flag set gives the best performance.

Embree also supports dynamic scenes by implementing high-performance
two-level spatial index structure construction algorithms.
