=============
OSPRay Studio
=============

Intel OSPRay Studio is an open source and interactive visualization
and ray tracing application that leverages Intel OSPRay as its core
rendering engine. It can be used to load complex scenes requiring high
fidelity rendering or very large scenes requiring supercomputing
resources.

The main control structure is a scene graph which allows users to
create an abstract scene in a directed acyclical graph manner. Scenes
can either be imported or created using scene graph nodes and
structure support. The scenes can then be rendered either with
OSPRay's pathtracer or scivis renderer.

More information can be found at the `OSPRay Studio website`_.
