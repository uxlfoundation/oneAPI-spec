OSPRay is a scalable, and portable ray tracing engine for
high-performance, high-fidelity visualization.

The purpose of OSPRay is to provide an open, powerful, and easy-to-use
rendering library that allows one to easily build applications that
use ray tracing based rendering for interactive applications
(including both surface- and volume-based visualizations).
