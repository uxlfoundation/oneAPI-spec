Random Number Generators Host Routines
======================================

.. rubric:: Structure

RNG domain contains two classes types:

   -  Engines (basic random number generators) classes, which holds
      the state of generator and is a source of independent and identically distributed random variables.
      Refer to :ref:`onemath_rng_engines_basic_random_number_generators`
      for a detailed description.
   -  Distribution classes templates (transformation classes) for different types of statistical
      distributions, for example, uniform, normal (Gaussian), binomial,
      etc. These classes contain all of the distributionâ€™s parameters
      (including generation method). Refer to :ref:`onemath_rng_distributions` for
      a detailed description of the distributions.

The RNG domain also contains two types of free functions:

   -  Generation routines. The current routines are used to obtain random
      numbers from a given engine with proper statistics defined by a
      given distribution. Refer to the :ref:`onemath_rng_generate_routine`
      section for a detailed description.
   -  Service routines. The routines are used to modify the engine state. Refer to :ref:`onemath_rng_service_routines` for a
      description of these routines.


Engine classes work with both generation and service routines. Distribution classes are used in
generation routines only. Refer to the :ref:`onemath_rng_usage_model`
section for the description of typical RNG scenario.
