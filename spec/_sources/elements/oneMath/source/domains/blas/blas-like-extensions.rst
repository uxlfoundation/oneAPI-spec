BLAS-like Extensions
====================


.. container::


   |onemath_full_name| DPC++ provides additional routines to extend
   the functionality of the BLAS routines. These include routines
   to compute many independent vector-vector and matrix-matrix operations.

   The following table lists the BLAS-like extensions with their descriptions.
