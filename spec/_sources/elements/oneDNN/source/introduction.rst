Introduction
############

Although the origins of this specification are in the existing `open source
implementation`_, its goal is to define a *portable* set of APIs.  To this
end, for example, it intentionally omits implementation-specific details like
tiled or blocked memory formats (layouts), and instead describes plain
multi-dimensional memory formats and defines opaque *optimized* memory format
that can be implementation specific.

oneDNN main concepts are *primitives*, *engines*, *streams*, and *memory
objects*.

A *primitive* (|primitive|) is a functor object that
encapsulates a particular computation such as forward convolution, backward
LSTM computations, or a data transformation operation. A single primitive can
sometimes represent more complex *fused* computations such as a forward
convolution followed by a ReLU. Fusion, among other things, is controlled via
the *primitive attributes* mechanism.

The most important difference between a primitive and a pure function is that
a primitive can be specialized for a subset of input parameters.

For example, a convolution primitive stores parameters like tensor shapes and
can pre-compute other dependent parameters like cache blocking. This approach
allows oneDNN primitives to pre-generate code specifically tailored for the
requested operation to be performed. The oneDNN programming model assumes that
the time it takes to perform the pre-computations is amortized by reusing the
same primitive to perform computations multiple times.

A primitive may also need a mutable memory buffer that it may use for
temporary storage only during computations. Such buffer is called a
scratchpad. It can either be owned by a primitive object (which makes that
object non-thread safe) or be an execution-time parameter.

Primitive creation is a potentially expensive operation. Users are expected to
create primitives once and reuse them multiple times. Alternatively,
implementations may reduce the primitive creation cost by caching primitives
that have the same parameters. This optimization falls outside of the scope of
this specification.

*Engines* (|engine|) are an abstraction of a computational
device: a CPU, a specific GPU card in the system, etc. Most primitives are
created to execute computations on one specific engine. The only exceptions
are reorder primitives that may transfer data between two different engines.

*Streams* (|stream|) encapsulate execution context tied to a
particular engine. For example, they can correspond to DPC++ command queues.

*Memory objects* (|memory|) encapsulate handles to memory
allocated on a specific engine, tensor dimensions, data type, and memory
format â€“ the way tensor indices map to offsets in linear memory space. Memory
objects are passed to primitives during execution.

.. rubric:: Levels of Abstraction

oneDNN has multiple levels of abstractions for primitives and memory objects
in order to expose maximum flexibility to its users.

On the logical level, the library provides the following abstractions:

* Memory descriptors (|memory::desc|) define the logical dimensions of a tensor,
  data type, and the format in which the data is laid out in memory. The special
  format any (|memory::format_tag::any|) indicates that the actual format will
  be defined later.

* Primitive descriptors (|primitive_desc_base| is the base class and each of the
  supported primitives have their own version) can be used to inspect
  details of a specific primitive implementation like expected memory formats
  via queries to implement memory format propagation (see :ref:`Memory format
  propagation <memory_format_propagation-label>`) without having to fully
  instantiate a primitive.

***************
Graph Extension
***************

The graph extension is a high level abstraction in oneDNN that allows to work with a
computation graph instead of individual primitives. This approach allows to
make operation fusion:

* transparent: the integration efforts are reduced by abstracting engine-aware
  fusion logic.

* scalable: no integration code change is necessary to benefit from new fusion
  patterns enabled in the oneDNN implementation.

The programming model for the graph extension is detailed in the
:ref:`graph programming model section <graph_programming_model-label>`.

*****************
General API notes
*****************

oneDNN objects can be *empty* in which case they are not valid for any use.
Memory descriptors are special in this regard, as their empty versions are
regarded as *zero* memory descriptors that can be used to indicate absence of a
memory descriptor. Empty objects are usually created using default constructors,
but also may be a result of an error during object construction (see the next
section).

**************
Error Handling
**************

All oneDNN functions throw the following exception in case of error.

.. doxygenstruct:: dnnl::error
   :project: oneDNN
   :members:

Additionally, many oneDNN functions that construct or return oneDNN objects have
a boolean ``allow_empty`` parameter that defaults to ``false`` and that makes
the library to return an empty object (a zero object in case of memory
descriptors) when an object cannot be constructed instead of throwing an error.

**********
Namespaces
**********

All oneDNN functions and classes reside in ``::dnnl`` namespace. The functions
that accept or return DPC++ objects such as command queues or buffers reside in
``::dnnl::sycl_interop`` namespace.

Furthermore, oneDNN defines ``::oneapi::dnnl`` namespace, that is an alias for
the ``::dnnl`` namespace.
