To push higher performance during inference computations, recent work has
focused on computations that use activations and weights stored at lower
precision to achieve higher throughput. Int8 computations offer improved
performance over higher-precision types because they enable packing more
computations into a single instruction, at the cost of reduced (but
acceptable) accuracy.

Quantization Model
==================

For each int8 tensor, the oneDNN library allows to specify scaling
factors and zero-points (also refered to as quantization
parameters), and assumes the following mathematical relationship:

.. math::

    x_{f32}[:] = scale_{x} \cdot (x_{int8}[:] - zp_{x})

where :math:`scale_{x}` is a *scaling factor* in float format,
:math:`zp_{x}` is the zero point in int32 format, and
:math:`[:]` is used to denote elementwise application of the formula
to the arrays. In order to provide best performance, oneDNN does not
compute those scaling factors and zero-points as part of primitive
computation. Those should be provided by the user through the
:ref:`attribute mecanism<attributes-quantization-label>`.

These quantization parameters can either be computed ahead of time
using calibration tools (*static* quantization) or at runtime based on
the actual minimum and maximum values of a tensor (*dynamic*
quantization). Either method can be used in conjuction with oneDNN, as
the quantization parameters are passed to the oneDNN primitives at
execution time.

To support int8 quantization, primitives should be created and
executed as follow:

- during primitive creation, if one or multiple inputs are int8
  (signed or not), then the primitive will behave as a quantized
  integer operation.
- still during primitive creation, the dimensionality of the scaling
  factors and zero-point should be provided using masks (e.g. one
  scale per tensor, one scale per channel, ...).
- finally, during primitive execution, the user must provide the
  actual quantization parameters as arguments to the execute function.
  Scales shall be f32 values, and zero-points shall be int32 values.

.. note::

   For performance reasons, each primitive implementation can support
   only a subset of quantization parameter masks. For example,
   convolution typically supports per-channel scales (no zero-point)
   for weights, and per-tensor scaling factor and zero-point for
   activation.

.. note::

   Some primitives might use quantization parameters in order to
   dequantize/quantize intermediate values. This is for example the
   case for the :ref:`rnn-label` primitive, which will dequantize
   before applying non linear functions, and will requantize before
   executing matrix multiplication operations.


Numerical behavior
__________________

Primitive implementations are allowed to convert int8 inputs to wider
datatypes (e.g. int16 or int32), as those conversions do not impact
accuracy.

During execution, primitives should avoid integer overflows and
maintain integer accuracy by using wider datatypes (e.g. int32) for
intermediate values and accumulators. Those are then converted as
necessary before the result is written to the output memory objects.
During that conversion, the behavior in case of underflow/overflow is
undefined (e.g. when converting `s32` to int8). However, it is highly
encouraged for implementations to saturate values.

When multiple operations are fused in a single primitive using the
:ref:`post-op mecanism<post_ops-label>`, those are assumed to be
computed in f32 precision. As a result the destination quantization
parameters are applied after the post-ops as follow:

.. math::

   \dst[:] = post\_ops(OP(src[:], weights[:], ...)) / scale_{\dst} + zp_{\dst}

Quantizing/dequantizing values between post-operations can still be
achieved using one of :ref:`eltwise post-ops<post_ops_eltwise-label>`,
:ref:`binary post-ops<post_ops_binary-label>`, or the scale parameter
of the appropriate post-operation.


Example: Convolution Quantization Workflow
------------------------------------------

Consider a convolution without bias. The tensors are represented as:

- :math:`\src_{f32}[:] = scale_{\src} \cdot (\src_{int8}[:] - zp_{\src})`
- :math:`\weights_{f32}[:] = scale_{\weights} \cdot \weights_{int8}[:]`
- :math:`\dst_{f32}[:] = scale_{\dst} \cdot (\dst_{int8}[:] - zp_{\dst})`

Here the :math:`\src_{f32}, \weights_{f32}, \dst_{f32}` are not
computed at all, the whole work happens with int8 tensors.So the task
is to compute the :math:`\dst_{int8}` tensor, using the `\src_{int8}`,
`\weights_{int8}` tensors passed at execution time, as well as the
corresponding quantization parameters `scale_{\src}, scale_{\weights},
scale_{\dst}` and `zero_point{\src},
zero_point_{\dst}`. Mathematically, the computations are:

.. math::

   \dst_{int8}[:] =
      \operatorname{f32\_to\_int8}(
         scale_{\src} \cdot scale_{\weights} \cdot
         \operatorname{s32\_to\_f32}(conv_{s32}(\src_{int8}, \weights_{int8})
	   - zp_{\src} \cdot comp_{s32}) / scale_{\dst}
           + zp_{\dst} )
      
where

- :math:`conv_{s32}` is just a regular convolution which takes source and
  weights with int8 data type and compute the result in int32 data type (int32
  is chosen to avoid overflows during the computations);

- :math:`comp_{s32}` is a compensation term to account for
  `\src` non-zero zero point. This term is computed by the oneDNN
  library and can typically be pre-computed ahead of time, for example
  during weights reorder.

- :math:`\operatorname{f32\_to\_s8}()` converts an `f32` value to `s8` with
  potential saturation if the values are out of the range of the int8 data
  type.

- :math:`\operatorname{s32\_to\_f32}()` converts an `int8` value to
  `f32` with potential rounding. This conversion is typically
  necessary to apply `f32` scaling factors.


Per-Channel Scaling
-------------------

Primitives may have limited support of multiple scales for a quantized tensor.
The most popular use case is the :ref:`convolution-label` primitives that
support per-output-channel scaling factors for the weights, meaning that the
actual convolution computations would need to scale different output channels
differently.

- :math:`\src_{f32}(n, ic, ih, iw) = scale_{\src} \cdot \src_{int8}(n, ic, ih, iw)`

- :math:`\weights_{f32}(oc, ic, kh, kw) = scale_{\weights}(oc) \cdot \weights_{int8}(oc, ic, kh, kw)`

- :math:`\dst_{f32}(n, oc, oh, ow) = scale_{\dst} \cdot \dst_{int8}(n, oc, oh, ow)`

Note that now the weights' scaling factor depends on :math:`oc`.

To compute the :math:`\dst_{int8}` we need to perform the following:

.. math::

    \dst_{int8}(n, oc, oh, ow) =
        \operatorname{f32\_to\_int8}(
            \frac{scale_{\src} \cdot scale_{\weights}(oc)}{scale_{\dst}} \cdot
            conv_{s32}(\src_{int8}, \weights_{int8})|_{(n, oc, oh, ow)}
        ).

The user is responsible for preparing quantized weights accordingly. To do that,
oneDNN provides reorders that can perform per-channel scaling:

.. math::

    \weights_{int8}(oc, ic, kh, kw) =
        \operatorname{f32\_to\_int8}(
            \weights_{f32}(oc, ic, kh, kw) / scale_{weights}(oc)
        ).

The :ref:`attributes-quantization-label` describes what kind of quantization
model oneDNN supports.
