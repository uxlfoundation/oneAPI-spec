-----------
Version 2.8
-----------

New in this release:

* Introduced :cpp:enumerator:`MFX_FOURCC_ABGR16F` FourCC for 16-bit float point (per channel) 4:4:4 ABGR format.
* Clarified the :cpp:member:`mfxExtMasteringDisplayColourVolume::DisplayPrimariesX`, :cpp:member:`mfxExtMasteringDisplayColourVolume::DisplayPrimariesY` for the video processing usage.
* Added :cpp:enumerator:`MFX_CONTENT_NOISY_VIDEO` in ContentInfo definition.
* Added Camera Processing API for Camera RAW data.
* Introduced hint to disable external video frames caching for GPU copy.
* Clarified usage of :cpp:member:`mfxExtMasteringDisplayColourVolume::InsertPayloadToggle` and
  :cpp:member:`mfxExtContentLightLevelInfo::InsertPayloadToggle` during decode operations.
* Fixed multiple spelling errors.
* Experimental API: introduced :cpp:member:`mfxExtMBQP::Pitch` value for QP map defined in :cpp:struct:`mfxExtMBQP`.
* Clarified when :cpp:func:`MFXEnumImplementations` may be called for implementation capabilities query.
* Added table with filenames included in the dispatcher's search process.

Bug Fixes:

* Fixed :ref:`Experimental API table <experimental-api-table>` to note that :cpp:type:`mfxExtRefListCtrl` and :cpp:enumerator:`MFX_EXTBUFF_UNIVERSAL_REFLIST_CTRL` were moved to production in version 2.8.

-----------
Version 2.7
-----------

New in this release:

* :cpp:member:`mfxExtVppAuxData::RepeatedFrame` flag is actual again and returned back from deprecation state.
* Clarified GPUCopy control behavior.
* Introduced MFX_FOURCC_XYUV FourCC for non-alpha packed 4:4:4 format.
* Notice added to the :cpp:member:`mfxFrameSurfaceInterface::OnComplete` to clarify when
  library can call this callback.
* New product names for platforms:

    * Code name Alder Lake N.

* Annotated missed aliases  :cpp:type:`mfxExtHEVCRefListCtrl`,  :cpp:type:`mfxExtHEVCRefLists`, :cpp:type:`mfxExtHEVCTemporalLayers`.
* New dispatcher's config properties:

    * Pass through extension buffer to :cpp:struct:`mfxInitializationParam`.
    * Select host or device responsible for the memory copy between host and device.

* Refined description of struct `mfxExtMasteringDisplayColourVolume` and `mfxExtContentLightLevelInfo` for HDR SEI decoder usage.
* Experimental API: introduced interface to get statistics after encode.

Bug Fixes:

* Fixed missprint in the :cpp:struct:`mfxExtDeviceAffinityMask` description.
* MFXVideoENCODE_Query description fixed for query mode 1.

-----------
Version 2.6

* Refined description of the MFXVideoDECODE_VPP_DecodeFrameAsync function.
* New dispatcher's config filter property: MediaAdapterType.
* Marked all deprecated fields as MFX_DEPRECATED.
* Introduced priority loading option for custom libraries. 
* Clarified AV1 encoder behavior about writing of IVF headers.
