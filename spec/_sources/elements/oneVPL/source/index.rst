The |vpl_full_name| (oneVPL) is a programming interface for video decoding,
encoding, and processing to build portable media pipelines on CPUs,
GPUs, and other accelerators. It provides device discovery and selection in
media centric and video analytics workloads and API primitives for zero-copy
buffer sharing. oneVPL is backwards and cross-architecture compatible to ensure
optimal execution on current and next generation hardware without source code
changes.
